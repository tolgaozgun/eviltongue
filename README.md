_Life or death, all depends on a simple twist of tongue!_

### Evil Tongue is a fun plugin created for both Bukkit and Spigot!

Whenever a person types a specific hidden string, they become the "Chosen One" and gain the ability to kill anyone by typing their nickname in the chat! There are some limitations when this player loses this ability, but you can change that via customizable config!

## Features:

- Saves the last "Chosen One" to config, so it does not get affected by reload or stop/start 
- Changable many settings
- Permission supported!
- Easy to manage config!
- Log included, you can see who did what!
